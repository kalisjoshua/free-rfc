Lean RFC can be adopted by projects of any size which wish to have a formal and consistent process for managing change without the burden of defining a custom process for the project.<h2 class="Conventions">Conventions</h2><p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.<h2 class="Motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Some project teams might want to <em>adopt</em> a process for RFCs rather than to focus development effort on defining a custom process for their project. Other project teams might want to adopt a generic process similar to other projects they have worked on so that getting into a process is more familiar for maintainers and contributors.<h2 class="Design">Design</h2><p>See <a href="https://github.com/kalisjoshua/lean-rfc">Lean RFC</a> for detail.<h3>Attribution</h3><p>Much of Lean RFC was inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">Rust-lang RFC repository</a>, so thank you to the Rust community for your contribution.<h2 class="Drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2><p>The only reason not to start a project like Lean RFC would be because no projects will adopt it or gain any benefit from it. As long as at least one person/project can gain benefit from it there was benefit in creating Lean RFC.<h2 class="Alternatives">Alternatives</h2><ul><li><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2026/">The Internet Standards Process</a> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2026/">RFC-2026</a> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2026/">BCP-9</a><ul><li>However, RFC-2026 might be too verbose for many projects that want something simpler to quickly adopt, implement, and follow.</ul></ul><h2 class="Unresolved (questions)">Unresolved (questions)</h2></article></div>
