Lean RFC can be adopted by projects of any size which wish to have a formal and consistent process for managing change without the burden of defining a custom process for the project.<h2 class="Conventions">Conventions</h2><p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.<h2 class="Motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Some project teams might want to <em>adopt</em> a process for RFCs rather than to focus development effort on defining a custom process for their project. Other project teams might want to adopt a generic process similar to other projects they have worked on so that getting into a process is more familiar for maintainers and contributors.<h2 class="Design">Design</h2><p>See <a href="https://github.com/kalisjoshua/lean-rfc">Lean RFC</a> for detail.<h3>Attribution</h3><p>Much of Lean RFC was inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">Rust-lang RFC repository</a>, so thank you to the Rust community for your contribution.<h2 class="Drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2><p>The only reason not to start a project like Lean RFC would be because no projects will adopt it or gain any benefit from it. As long as at least one person/project can gain benefit from it there was benefit in creating Lean RFC.<h2 class="Alternatives">Alternatives</h2><ul><li><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2026/">The Internet Standards Process</a> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2026/">RFC-2026</a> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2026/">BCP-9</a><ul><li>However, RFC-2026 might be too verbose for many projects that want something simpler to quickly adopt, implement, and follow.</ul></ul><h2 class="Unresolved (questions)">Unresolved (questions)</h2></article><article data-topics="process,information-presentation"data-type="root"id="0001-github-pages"><h1><a href="#0001-github-pages">0001 - RFC Automation</a></h1><ul><li>Discussion: <a href="https://github.com/kalisjoshua/lean-rfc/pull/2">https://github.com/kalisjoshua/lean-rfc/pull/2</a><li>Replaces: none<li>Replaced by: none<li>Topics: process, information-presentation</ul><h2 class="Summary">Summary</h2><p>GitHub Pages allows for rendering the content of an RFC inside a customizable static web page. This allows for customizing the UI to view RFCs in a manner that scales well as the number of RFCs grows.<h2 class="Conventions">Conventions</h2><p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.<h2 class="Motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Navigating a mature RFC repo in git can be very time consuming, so this solution seeks to address the way in which users navigate the repo itself. By abstracting away the repository and presenting the relevant information in a customizable manner, we can get around some of the biggest hurdles when it comes to finding relevant information in a large RFC repo.<h2 class="Design">Design</h2><p>See <a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a> for specific implementation and details. This proposal is to use the GitHub pages functionality to present the contents of the RFC repo.<h2 class="Drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2><p>This recommendation involves setting up a certain amount of automation and testing around deploying the github page, and also requires work to customize the presentation of the static site. It does not change or break the underlying RFC information in the RFC repo, so adding this feature will not preclude anyone from navigating the RFC repo in git. So, the only reason not to do this would be if the team cannot spare the time to set up the deployment and customization of the static page.<h2 class="Alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>A custom application could be built to fetch the data from the github repo and present it how we want. However, this would be duplicating a large part of the functionality offered by GitHub Pages.<h2 class="Unresolved (questions)">Unresolved (questions)</h2><p>The exact customization parameters we want to use for the static site have not been determined. It has only been determined that it is fairly customizable.</article></div>
