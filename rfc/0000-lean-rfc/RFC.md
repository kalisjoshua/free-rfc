# Lean RFC Project

  * Replaced by: none
  * Topics: decision, process


## Summary
[Summary]: #summary

[Lean RFC] is an open, collaborative, and evolving example of a standardized
process for handling RFCs; keeping in mind the core tenets of: simplicity,
thoroughness, and transparency. Lean RFC can be adopted by projects of any size
which wish to have a formal and consistent process for managing change without
the burden of defining a custom process for the project.


## Conventions
[Conventions]: #conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).


## Motivation
[Motivations]: #motivations

Some project teams might want to *adopt* a process for RFCs rather than to
focus development effort on defining a custom process for their project. Other
project teams might want to adopt a generic process similar to other projects
they have worked on so that getting into a process is more familiar for
maintainers and contributors.


## Design
[Design]: #design

See [Lean RFC] for detail.


### Attribution
[Attribution]: #attribution

Much of Lean RFC was inspired by the [Rust-lang RFC repository], so thank you
to the Rust community for your contribution.


## Drawbacks
[Drawbacks]: #drawbacks

The only reason not to start a project like Lean RFC would be because no
projects will adopt it or gain any benefit from it. As long as at least one
person/project can gain benefit from it there was benefit in creating Lean RFC.


## Alternatives
[Alternatives]: #alternatives

  * [The Internet Standards Process][BCP-9] [RFC-2026][BCP-9] [BCP-9]
      + However, RFC-2026 might be too verbose for many projects that want
        something simpler to quickly adopt, implement, and follow.
